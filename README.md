# Welcome!
Here is a collection of some of my recent projects:

I am a recent graduate of Long Island University where I majored in Data Analytics and Business Management.
I was actively involved on campus, playing collegiate baseball, a member of the Data Analytics Society, and a Dean scholar.

My favorite project is titled "epitopeValence.r" where I employed a decison tree to predict covid antibodies production.
Other machine learning algorithms I have utilized are naive Bayes, linear regression, apriori, K-NN, and more!
